Description: This package address the challenge of tracking data files within 
    git. It works by creating multiple versions of datafiles, and updating a text
    file that records the current version. It is disk space intensive and likely 
    not an appropriate solution for files that are very large and change 
    frequently. The user should first run `make_data_vc()` which will create the
    tracking file ("data_vc" by default) in the root directory. All subsequent 
    data files should be saved and read using saveRDS_vc and readRDS_vc, these 
    functions behave exactly the same as their base versions, except that they access 
    the "data_vc" file to track the `stamp` prefix and write/read the appropriate 
    file. The default stamp is Sys.Date() and will not track changes within a day, 
    use Sys.time() for more granular tracking. Git commits of changes to "data_vc"
    will allow the user toreturn to any previous commit of the project and 
    automatically access the data in the state that it existed at that point in 
    the git history.
