Problem - when updating file in `update_version_control` the config lines are erased.
Beacuse skipping config lines, they aren't read-in to be resaved. So, need to read in
config params, write them, then write updates.

Also need to modify dta and rds write functions so default for version_control param is
read off of the config data.
